# Project 1: {MS-Azure-ML-Capstone-Project}(https://github.com/jyotisood/MS-Azure-ML-Capstone-Project)

## Overview
This Capstone project is the final requisite in Udacity Microsoft Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we work with a dataset of our choice to solve a Machine Learning problem using two approaches in Azure ML - AutoML and Hyperdrive. Finally the best model, out of both is chosen, deployed and consumed.

For this project, I chose to work on a breast Cancer prediction dataset. Research shows that Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer. This could be used in developing easy to use applications that use Machine learning techniques to predict the existence of cancer and take steps in a timely manner.
