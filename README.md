# Project 1: [Google_Capstone_Project](https://github.com/jyotisood/Google_Capstone_Project)
## Overview
This Capstone project was the final project in Coursera's Google Analytics course. In this project, I analysed the bank marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* The data (bank-additional-full.csv) was related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese bank. The data consisted of 41188 rows and 21 columns.

* The end goal of this campaign is to find out whether the campaign was successful to motivate customers to subscribe to a bank term deposit.

* Randomly targeting every customer leads to wastage of time and resources. The analysis would also help us identify the right demographic to target for bank marketing campaign in future and return a better return on investment (ROI).

# Project 2: [MS-Azure-ML-Capstone-Project](https://github.com/jyotisood/MS-Azure-ML-Capstone-Project)

## Overview
This Capstone project was the final project in Udacity's Microsoft Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, I worked with a dataset of my choice to solve a Machine Learning problem using two approaches in Azure ML - AutoML and Hyperdrive. Finally the best model, out of both is chosen, deployed and consumed.

For this project, I chose to work on a breast Cancer prediction dataset. Research shows that Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer. This could be used in developing easy to use applications that use Machine learning techniques to predict the existence of cancer and take steps in a timely manner.

# Project 3: [Capstone Project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://github.com/jyotisood/Udacity_Capstone_Project)
### Project Overview
In this project, I used machine learning to analyze data provided by mail order sales company of Germany and compared it to the demographic information of the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I applied the learning on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and used a xgboost classifier model to predict which customers who are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data I used for this project was provided by Udacity and Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

### The project has 3 major parts:
* Customer Segmentation Report: Here, I used unsupervised learning techniques to describe the relationship between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population of Germany. By end of this this part, I was able to describe parts of the general population that are more likely to be part of the mail-order company's main customer base, and which parts of the general population are less so.
* Supervised Learning Model: In this part of the project I built and tested a prediction model that predicts whether or not an individual would respond to a mail out campaign. Here attributes of a third dataset ‘mailout’ from mail campaign were used to test the model. 
* Kaggle Competition: Once best performing model was identified, it was used to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. The probability of individuals were ranked by how likely they are to convert to being a customer. Based on these results of our modeling skills, we are tested against our peers.


# Project 4: [Office_Store_Capstone_Columbia_Emeritus](https://github.com/jyotisood/Office_Store_Capstone_Columbia_Emeritus)
This Capstone Project was a part of the Post Graduate Diploma for Applied Machine Learning by Emeritus and Columbia University.The original dataset consists 16173 customers information who have been a target of a marketing campaign of an office supplies company.The below were the main tasks:

- Profile the customers that responded to the campaign to make the company aware of who its typical customer is.
- Develop models that will allow the company to use the results of the campaign to target future, similar campaigns.
- Show the financial value of your models.
